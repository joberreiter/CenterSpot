## Usage
- Print the template on a sheet of plain or transparency paper
- Cut out the innermost triangle using a cutter or scalpel
- Position the template centric over the spot to be applied
- Fixate the spot with adhesive tape
- Flip template and spot over and remove the release paper from the spot
- By holding the template with your hands right and left, position it over the
  (main) mirror, until the template is perfectly centered
- Ask another person to press the template center with the underlying spot onto the mirror,
  attaching the spot to the mirror surface
- Press firmly, then remove the adhesive tape (and the template) with caution
- Done, you have marked the center of your mirror without hassle
